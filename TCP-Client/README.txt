 
The code provided “registers” a controller when it is plugged in (I believe USB only) 


Instructions:
(First time) Run the jar; this will create the config file.
Specify the IP and port number in the config file.
Start up a TCP server on that IP and port number.
Run the jar again.
To get joystick inputs plug a controller in.
